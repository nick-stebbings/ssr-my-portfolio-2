While it is always the day-to-day actions that one must focus on, as a result of this top-down way of thinking it can be difficult to link daily actions to the bigger picture and make consistent progress.\\r\\n\\r\\nConversely, many people are great at breaking down and acting on small-magnitude behaviours (the list-writers!). Habit/Fract came about as a way of uniting the two modes of thinking in a way that provides visual cues and helps to build and break down habitual behaviour over time.",
